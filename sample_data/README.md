# Sample In Vivo Hyperpolarized MRI Data

The in vivo hyperpolarized MRI data contained in the folders here comes from animal and human studies, and was acquired with different methods that are described below.

## Rat Kidneys Dynamic MRS

This dataset contains slab-selective dynamic MR spectroscopy, acquired in normal rat kidneys.  There are repeated injections ("shots") for each animal (originally to look for stability or changes in metabolism across injections).

Further details and analysis can be found in:
