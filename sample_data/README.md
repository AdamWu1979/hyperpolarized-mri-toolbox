# Sample In Vivo Hyperpolarized MRI Data

The in vivo hyperpolarized MRI data contained in the folders here comes from animal and human studies, and was acquired with different methods that are described below.

## Rat Kidneys Dynamic MRS

This dataset contains slab-selective dynamic MR spectroscopy, acquired in normal rat kidneys.  There are repeated injections ("shots") for each animal (originally to look for stability or changes in metabolism across injections).

Further details and analysis can be found in:
Hu, Simon, Peder E Z Larson, Mark Vancriekinge, Andrew M Leach, Ilwoo Park, Christine Leon, Jenny Zhou, et al. “Rapid Sequential Injections of Hyperpolarized [1-¹³C]Pyruvate in Vivo Using a Sub-Kelvin, Multi-Sample DNP Polarizer.” Magn Reson Imaging 31, no. 4 (May 2013): 490–96. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mri.2012.09.002.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23107275

## Rat Kidneys EPI

This dataset contains pyruvate and lactate dynamic imaging using metabolite-specific imaging with EPI.  Experiment 1 used a variable flip angle scheme (`exp1_vfa`) while experiment 2 used a constant-in-time flip angle scheme (`exp2_const`).  The `.mat` files contain the flip angles used at each time point.

The metabolite-specific imaging with EPI is described in:
